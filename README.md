This is a plugin for Netbeans 27+ that allows you to run a git bash session within the IDE, similar to the existing Terminal function. 

This module uses ant as the build system. To build the project, run the command 

ant nbm

This will create build/ie-philb-gitbash.nbm

This is an unsigned netbeans module and can be installed in Netbeans by selecting Tools -> Plugins. This will show a dialog with multiple tabs. Select the Downloaded tab.
Click the  "Add Plugins..." button
Select the nbm file
Select Install

This will create a menu item in the "Tools" menu. Select this to start git bash in a panel inside Netbeans.
